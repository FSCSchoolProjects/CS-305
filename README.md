# ðŸ“„ Project Artifact: Artemis Financial Practices for Secure Software Report

This project involved identifying and mitigating software vulnerabilities for a fictional client, Artemis Financial, a company that handles sensitive financial data and requires secure software to protect client information. The organization requested a code review to assess the security of their financial application and ensure adherence to secure coding standards.

## Summary & Purpose
Artemis Financial is a financial services company that needed a security-focused review of its software. The primary issue was ensuring that the software followed secure coding practices and avoided vulnerabilities that could lead to data breaches or unauthorized access. The company wanted to improve the reliability and security of its system to maintain client trust and regulatory compliance.

## Highlights of Work & Importance of Secure Coding
I performed a vulnerability assessment and found potential risks such as improper input validation and insufficient error handling. One key strength in my approach was applying secure coding principles and following OWASP guidelines to identify areas needing improvement. Secure coding is essential because it prevents data leaks, maintains business integrity, and ensures customer confidence in digital platforms.

## Challenges & Helpful Areas
One challenge was understanding how to properly structure error messages to avoid revealing too much system information while maintaining clarity for users. However, reviewing the software for logic flaws and testing edge cases provided insight into potential exploitation paths, which was very beneficial for understanding real-world risks.

## Enhancing Security Layers
I enhanced the softwareâ€™s security by validating user input, handling exceptions securely, and removing hard-coded credentials. In future projects, I would use automated tools such as SonarQube, Bandit, or OWASP Dependency-Check to scan for vulnerabilities and prioritize them based on severity and exploitability.

## Functional Testing & Validation
After refactoring the code to resolve vulnerabilities, I conducted manual and automated tests to ensure functionality was not broken. I also used version control tools to track changes and verify that no new vulnerabilities were introduced during the updates.

## Tools & Best Practices for Future Use
Some tools and practices I found helpful and plan to reuse include:

  - Static code analysis tools
  - Secure exception handling patterns
  - Proper use of access control and least privilege
  - Applying the principle of defense in depth

## Value to Future Employers
This assignment demonstrates my ability to review, refactor, and secure real-world software, a critical skill in todayâ€™s cybersecurity-conscious industry. It also reflects my ability to assess code for security flaws, document vulnerabilities, and apply secure design principles â€” a strong example of my capabilities in secure software development.
